MCPROXY

Aims to be a simple and extendable proxy for use with
Minecraft.  Currently, the proxy forwards the data,
inspects packets, and offers a simple shell usable
through chat by prefixing chat messages with #.

Commands are not implimented yet (although they show up
under #help).

There is a simple interface for writing plugins that
can be enabled and configured through the shell.
(not quite yet...)

Requires Twisted, Bravo, and yapsy (included).
