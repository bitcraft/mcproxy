MCPROXY

Aims to be a simple and extendable proxy for use with
Minecraft.  Currently, the proxy forwards the data,
inspects packets, and offers a simple shell usable
through chat by prefixing chat messages with #.

Right now, all shell commands are forwarded, be warned.

Uses the bravo library for packet imformation.
